### What is Tracka Keepa ###

Tracka Keepa is a time keeping web application. Specific features will a task interruption tracker, physical button integration and anything else that comes to mind. I expect the project will develop a personality as development progresses.

## Tests ##

Tests are run with Protractor and Cucumber. WebDriver must be running in order for the gulp tests to run.

    webdriver-manager update
    webdriver-manager start
